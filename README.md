# 1st class netizen's Chromium Sater
This is a persistent AutoHotkey launching file proxy macro to create a 3rd method so that no one has to choose between "To get future Chromium updates [...]" and using --test-type to get around "Managed by your organization" on Chromium forks as shown in this video: https://archive.is/sBKwH.

**Current version:** 1.1
### Supported Platforms
Windows 7. Windows 10 hasn't been tested, though this may be looked into if and when there are nag push notifications for Windows 10.
### Done or Discarded Compatibility Tests
32 and 64-bit system type executables were tested using Ungoogled Chromium from a restart to ensure they were working. The browser has only been run from a SSD, however with the delta of around 6 total seconds to launch from restart and 1 second afterwards and it stll working, it is most likely entirely a memory delay rather than CPU, and thus should work on a disk drive.
