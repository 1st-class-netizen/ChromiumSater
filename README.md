# Balloonguy or 1st class netizen's Chromium Sater
This is a persistent AutoHotkey launching file proxy macro to create a 3rd method so that no one has to choose between "To get future Chromium updates [...]" and using --test-type to get around "Managed by your organization" on Chromium forks as shown in this video.

32 and 64-bit were tested using Ungoogled Chromium from a restart to ensure they were working. The browser has so far only been run from a SSD, however with the delta of around 6 total seconds to launch from restart and 1 second afterwards and it stll working, it is most likely entirely a memory delay rather than CPU, and thus should work on a disk drive.

# Compile Instructions

Source requires the latest version of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to run.
